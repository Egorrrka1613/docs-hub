# Toolchain Installation

This guide will help you to install the Fuel toolchain binaries and pre requisites. 

This guide covers the following topics:
1. [Installing rust](#installing-rust)
2. [Installing the fuel toolchain using fuelup](#installing-the-fuel-toolchain-using-fuelup)
3. [Setting up a default toolchain](#setting-up-a-default-toolchain)

## Installing rust

The Fuel toolchain is built on top of the Rust programming language. To install Rust, you can use the `rustup` tool.

Run the following command in your shell; this downloads and runs rustup-init.sh, which in turn downloads and runs the correct version of the rustup-init executable for your platform.

```console
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

Check the official Rust documentation to get more information on [installing the Rust toolchain](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

## Installing the fuel toolchain using fuelup

`fuelup` is the official package manager for Fuel that installs the Fuel toolchain
from the official release channels, enabling you to easily switch between different
toolchains and keep them updated. It makes building and maintaining Sway applications
simpler with [forc](docs/forc) and [fuel-core](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core) for common platforms.

> ğŸ’¡ Check out the [Fuelup docs](docs/fuelup) for more information.


### Running fuelup-init

To install the fuel toolchain, you'll use the `fuelup-init` script. This will install `forc`, `forc-client`, `forc-fmt`, `forc-lsp`, `forc-wallet` as well as `fuel-core` in `~/.fuelup/bin`.

ğŸ‘‰ Just paste the following line in your terminal and press _Enter_.

```sh
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://install.fuel.network/fuelup-init.sh | sh
```

> ğŸš§ Be aware that currently  we do not natively support Windows. If you wish to use `fuelup` on Windows, please use Windows Subsystem for Linux.

### Setup PATH

Once the script is downloaded it will be executed automatically. The `fuelup-init` script will prompt something as this.

```sh
fuelup uses "/home/username/.fuelup" as its home directory to manage the Fuel toolchain, and will install binaries there.

To use the toolchain, you will have to configure your PATH, which tells your machine where to locate fuelup and the Fuel toolchain.

If permitted, fuelup-init will configure your PATH for you by running the following:

    echo "export PATH="$HOME/.fuelup/bin:$PATH"" >> /home/username/.bashrc

Would you like fuelup-init to modify your PATH variable for you? (N/y)
```

ğŸ‘‰ If this is your first time installing the Fuel toolchain just press the `Y` key in your terminal and press _Enter_ 

### Checking the installation

After allowing the `fuelup-init` script to modify your `PATH` variable, you will see a lot of information about packages being downloaded and installed. If everything goes as expected you will see the following message: 

```sh
The Fuel toolchain is installed and up to date

fuelup 0.19.5 has been installed in /home/username/.fuelup/bin. 
To fetch the latest toolchain containing the forc and fuel-core binaries, run 'fuelup toolchain install latest'. 
To generate completions for your shell, run 'fuelup completions --shell=SHELL'.
```

ğŸ‘‰ Use `fuelup --version`any time to check which version of the package you are using.

```sh
 fuelup --version
```
That will output your current `fuelup` verison:

```sh
fuelup 0.19.5
```

## Setting up a default toolchain

Just as seen in [rust](https://rust-lang.github.io/rustup/concepts/toolchains.html) Fuel supports multiple toolchains. A toolchain is a collection of tools (such as the compiler, lsp, etc).
By default, Fuelup includes a series of toolchain with packages tested to work with each other, providing a realiable set of tools.

In this case, we will install the `beta-4` toolchain, which is the stable toolchain compatible with the beta-4 network. For more information on `beta-4` check the [Fuel blog](https://fuel-labs.ghost.io/announcing-beta-4-testnet/) page.

### Updating fuelup

Make sure you have the latest version of `fuelup` so you can accesses the latest features and have the best performance.

ğŸ‘‰ Update `fuelup`  by running the following command:

```console
fuelup self update
```
Then you will get an output like this:
```console
Fetching binary from https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuelup/releases/download/v0.19.5/fuelup-0.19.5-aarch64-apple-darwin.tar.gz
Downloading component fuelup without verifying checksum
Unpacking and moving fuelup to /var/folders/tp/0l8zdx9j4s9_n609ykwxl0qw0000gn/T/.tmpiNJQHt
Moving /var/folders/tp/0l8zdx9j4s9_n609ykwxl0qw0000gn/T/.tmpiNJQHt/fuelup to /Users/.fuelup/bin/fuelup
```

### Installing the beta-4 toolchain

The beta-4 network is the latest Fuel testnet. This includes public infrastructure such a the [Beta-4 faucet](https://faucet-beta-4.fuel.network/) and the [Beta-4 GraphQL endpoint](https://beta-4.fuel.network/playground).

To properly interact with the `beta-4` network is necessary to use it's corresponding toolchain.

ğŸ‘‰ Run the following command to install the `beta-4`:

```console
fuelup toolchain install beta-4
```
If the toolchain was successfully installed, you will see this output:

```sh
The Fuel toolchain is installed and up to date
```

The toolchain was installed correctly, however is in use yet. You need to indicate `fuelup` to use the `beta-4` toolchain.

ğŸ‘‰ set the `beta-4` as your default toolchain with the following command:

```console
fuelup default beta-4
```

You will get the following output indicating that you are ready to go. 

```console
default toolchain set to 'beta-4'
```

### Checking your current toolchain

Sometimes you might end up using multiples toolchain at once, don't worry if you get confused about wich toolchain your are using since you can check your current toolchain anytime.

ğŸ‘‰ Run the `fuelup show` command to see toolchain that your are using and the version of the binaries of that toolchain.

```sh
fuelup show
```

This command will give you the following output

```sh
active toolchain
-----------------
beta-4-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu (default)
  forc : 0.45.0
    - forc-client
      - forc-deploy : 0.45.0
      - forc-run : 0.45.0
    - forc-doc : 0.45.0
    - forc-explore : 0.28.1
    - forc-fmt : 0.45.0
    - forc-index : 0.20.7
    - forc-lsp : 0.45.0
    - forc-tx : 0.45.0
    - forc-wallet : 0.3.0
  fuel-core : 0.20.4
  fuel-core-keygen : Error getting version string
  fuel-indexer : 0.20.7

fuels versions

forc : 0.45
forc-wallet : 0.45
```

As you can see the beta-4 toolchain is active ğŸš€

## What's next?

Now you are ready to start building with Fuel.

## Beyond the basics

### Custom toolchains

You can create your own set of specific versions, this is known as 'custom toolchains'. 

> ğŸ‘‰ Visit the [Fuelup docs](docs/fuelup/concepts/toolchains) to learn how to set up your own custom toolchains.

### Build form source

You can always build the Fuel packages from source.

> ğŸ‘‰ visit the [Fuelup docs](docs/fuelup/install/other) to get more details other types of installation.

### Github codespaces

It's always possible to run a developement enviroment on the browser.
