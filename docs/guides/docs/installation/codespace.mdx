# Github Codespace

### Introduction

The way to think about [Github Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) is essentially VSCode in a browser. It’s a remote development environment that is extremely easy to spin up. While not all VSCode plugins are supported, the Sway LSP plugin is supported and works out of the box.

### How to set up for a new repo

1. Create a devcontainer.json file. The easiest way is by navigating to the repo and clicking Code → … → Configure dev container

2. Edit the file to include the following features:
    
    ```json
    "features": {
        "ghcr.io/devcontainers/features/common-utils:1": {},
        "ghcr.io/FuelLabs/devcontainer-features/fuelup:1.0.1": {},
    }
    ```
    
3. Add any plugins that you want to be installed for this repo under “customizations”. 
    
    ```json
    "customizations": {
        "vscode": {
            "extensions": [
                "fuellabs.sway-vscode-plugin"
            ]
        }
    }
    ```
    
    Here are examples that include the Sway LSP plugin.
    
    1. [https://github.com/FuelLabs/sway/blob/master/.devcontainer/devcontainer.json](https://github.com/FuelLabs/sway/blob/master/.devcontainer/devcontainer.json)
    2. [https://github.com/FuelLabs/quickstart/blob/master/.devcontainer/devcontainer.json](https://github.com/FuelLabs/quickstart/blob/master/.devcontainer/devcontainer.json)

### How to start a codespace

1. Navigate to the repo that has codespaces configured.
2. Choose Code → Create codespace on master

3. This will open a new tab with your codespace. It can take several minutes to start up. 
    1. You now have a fully functional remote dev environment with the fuel toolchain installed! You can use `forc` to build and deploy sway code, or `fuelup` to manage the toolchain version. You also have the Sway LSP plugin with full feature support for sway, like syntax highlighting, hover docs, go-to definition, etc. 
    2. Note: if you are working on a large repository and find the codespace is running slow, you can configure it to use a larger instance by clicking Code → … → change machine type on a running instance, or starting a new instance with Code → … → New with options.

### Suggested uses

This is a great tool for hackathons! Users can easily get started with a full development environment without having to install anything on their personal machine, which could be a barrier for people who are new to Fuel/Sway.

### Pricing & billing

For all contributors that are part of the Github organization, Codespaces is billed to Fuel. For other users, they will be required to enter billing information. There is a substantial free tier so hackathon users don’t have to worry about getting billed as long as they shut down the codespace when they’re finished using it.

## What's next?

Now you are ready to start building with Fuel, check out the [quickstart guide](/guides/quickstart) to get started.
